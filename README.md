bitcoin-ws-monitor
==================

This example is a clone of http://bitcoinmonitor.com using WebSockets instead of long polling. On the backend it uses JSR 356 API for WebSockets. This example is inspired by bitcoin-rt https://github.com/cbeams/bitcoin-rt. The client side of this application is same.
